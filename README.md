# Yolov5_Object_Detection
Bridge Crack Detection by Fine-tuning YOLOv5

## Steps

1. **Gather a dataset of images and labels** from Roboflow Universe.
2. **Export the dataset** to YOLOv5 format.
3. **Train YOLOv5** to recognize the objects in the dataset.
4. **Evaluate the model's performance** on a validation set.
5. **Run test inference** to see the model in action and view predictions on test images.
